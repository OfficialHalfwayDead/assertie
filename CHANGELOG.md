# Changelog

## [0.2.0](https://github.com/OfficialHalfwayDead/assertie/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0) (2025-02-17)

### Breaking Changes

* [`a721e02`](https://github.com/OfficialHalfwayDead/assertie/commit/a721e02b2e8b7378f4dc017e02c2dd48ba899bfb) Renamed all `assertTypeof` to `assertTypeOf` for readability and consistency with `assertInstanceOf`. Sorry for the instant breaking change if anyone was already using it. Better now than carrying that inconsistency around forever.

### Features

* [`76ff555`](https://github.com/OfficialHalfwayDead/assertie/commit/76ff555cbb3a17d27c07642b078f96cd807812ba) Add `assertNull` as it was the only option in `assertType(val, null)` that didn't have an individual function counterpart.
